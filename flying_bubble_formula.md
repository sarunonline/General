# Flying Bubble Solution

A bubble solution is made with the following ingredients (percentages are by weight of the final Solution): 

* EDTA-2Na          : approximately 0.05%
* Propylene glycol  : approximately 1% 
* Lauryl betaine    : approximately 3% 
* Natural starch (Natrosol 250HHR): approximately 0.5% 
* Phenova           : approximately 0.5%
* De-ionized water  : approximately 94.95% 

The Phenova used has the following composition (percentages are by weight of the Phenova): 

* 2-Phenoxyethanol           : > 30% 
* Methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate   : 15-30% 
* Ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate    : <5% 
* Butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate    : <5%
* Isobutyl 4-hydroxybenzoate : <5%
* Propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate   : <5%.  

The de-ionized water is first heated in a mixing tank by a heater to approximately 70 degrees C. then EDTA-2Na and Natrosol 250HHR are 
added (order not important) into the hot water and stirred with a stirrer at a speed of 300 rpm until the solution is completely uniform. Propylene glycol, lauryl betaine, and Phenova are first fixed in a separate container until uniformity is reached and then poured into the mixing tank while the water is still warm and the Natrosol 250 HHR is completely dissolved. The final solution is cooled down to room temperature, around 25-30 degrees C., by running cold water through the cooling jacket of the mixing tank. 

The resulting example solution is a non-toxic clear liquid with a pH value of about 5.0 and a viscosity of approximately 260 cps, both measured at about 25 degrees C. When used together with a typical conventional bubble-blowing wand in a usual manner, it was observed that more than 60 bubbles were formed from a single dipping of the wand in the example solution.
