## Patent No: US2427921A

|Ingredients |Parts |
|---|---|
Methyl Violet |0.72 |
|Victoria Blue| 1.68 |
|Oleic acid 2.42 |
|Mineral oil| 0.84|

In preparing this ink the methyl violet, victoria blue and oleic acid are heated to about 65 C. and held for 15 minutes while continuously stirring the batch. The hot mixture is removed from the source of heat and as the mixture cools, the mineral oil is stirred into it. The mixture is then run twice over a three roller, water cooled ink mill and the ends are thrown away, thereby forming a stable, viscous homogeneous ink with an extremely long body which is free from large and rough particles.


## Patent No: EP0030389A1
